Assumptions:
- That all actively used records on the website from TCA configured tables are located in the page tree exclusively.

All records managed by TYPO3 via the TCA array configuration has to belong to a page in the page tree, either directly or indirectly as a version of another record.
VERY TIME, CPU and MEMORY intensive operation since the full page tree is looked up!

Automatic Repair of Errors:
- Silently deleting the orphaned records. In theory they should not be used anywhere in the system, but there could be references. See below for more details on this matter.

Manual repair suggestions:
- Possibly re-connect orphaned records to page tree by setting their "pid" field to a valid page id. A lookup in the sys_refindex table can reveal if there are references to a orphaned record. If there are such references (from records that are not themselves orphans) you might consider to re-connect the record to the page tree, otherwise it should be safe to delete it.
');
        $this->cli_help['todo'] = trim('
- Implement a check for references to orphaned records and if a reference comes from a record that is not orphaned itself, we might rather like to re-connect the record to the page tree.
- Implement that orphans can be fixed by setting the PID to a certain page instead of deleting.');
